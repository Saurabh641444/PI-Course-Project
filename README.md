# PI-Course-Project
This repository contains code of my Process Instrumentation Course Project
## Objective:-
Tune a discrete PID controller and test the performance with a series of
setpoint changes over 10 min in the sequence from 23 degree C initially, 50 degree C at 10 sec, and
40degree C at 300 sec. Modify the tuning parameters to achieve a low Integral Absolute Error
between the measured temperature and the setpoint.
## Circuit Diagram:-
## Instead of Arduino uno we have use tclab simulation in python by using tclabModule 
## TCLab PID Control Simulator
A simulator is a useful tool to help evaluate changes in tuning before testing on
a physical system. Use the PID simulator to find acceptable control performance that
minimizes the integral absolute error between the setpoint and measured temperature.
## PID control validation
## Conclusion
The value obtained by Arduino simulation= 2190.55

The value generated by python code= 1731.72

Mathematical value = Practical value
